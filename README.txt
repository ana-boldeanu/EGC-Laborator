// Boldeanu Ana-Maria
// 3rd Year - Computer Graphics Projects

	* The current wrapper contains my main OpenGL projects for this
semester. The main source code is located in:

  --> 3D SkiFree game:
EGC-Laborator\gfx-framework-master\src\lab_m1\skifree

  --> 3D Car race game:
EGC-Laborator\gfx-framework-master\src\lab_m1\race

  --> 2D Duck Hunt game:
EGC-Laborator\gfx-framework-master\src\lab_m1\duckhunt

	* To run one of the above games, open main.cpp from path
EGC-Laborator\gfx-framework-master\src\main.cpp and edit the line
World* world = new m1::SkiFree();
